# GreedySnake
This is a snake game I created by learning from FreeCodeCamp's youtube video.
You can control the snake with top, down, left, right. 
There is message dispaly after each round with the reason you lose and the score you got for that round.
You can press the enter/return key to start a new game.
Notice how I made the snake and the snack the same color as the logo of Python.
